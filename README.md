Welcome to a refined and polished collection of Emacs-inspired themes, carefully adapted for Visual Studio Code. This repository contains a fixed, curated version of the [ef-themes-vscode](https://github.com/anhsirk0/ef-themes-vscode) collection. ✨

All original themes are credited to [anhsirk0](https://github.com/anhsirk0) and the creator of the [ef-themes for Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes/). This version enhances the original set by fixing inconsistencies, ensuring modern formatting, and adding several themes that were missing from the original port. 🎯🎨

## 🚀 Installation Guide

Follow these simple steps to install:

For standard VSCode users:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eztamb/ef-themes-vscode-fixed.git ~/.vscode/extensions/eztamb.ef-themes-fixed-1.0.0
```

**Note:** If the extension doesn't appear after installation, remove the extensions manifest and reload VS Code:

```bash
rm ~/.vscode/extensions/extensions.json
```

For OSS or VSCodium users:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eztamb/ef-themes-vscode-fixed.git ~/.vscode-oss/extensions/eztamb.ef-themes-fixed-1.0.0
